# SimpleWebApi
It's just simple WebApi with some operations.
I've used jQuery to make ajax requests.
Note: No databases are used.

You can make GET request and receive JSON/XML. Let's try JSON:
![GET](https://github.com/BackNot/SimpleWebApi/blob/master/PicturesOfProject/GetJSON.png)


You can make GET request with specific ID:
![GET](https://github.com/BackNot/SimpleWebApi/blob/master/PicturesOfProject/GetJSON2.png)

In the 'RAW result' block the jqXHR object will set the status code and text returned from the WebApi.

By clicking 'POST' button a form is shown:
![POST](https://github.com/BackNot/SimpleWebApi/blob/master/PicturesOfProject/POST2.png)


When you submit it a javascript alert is shown:

![POST](https://github.com/BackNot/SimpleWebApi/blob/master/PicturesOfProject/DonePOST.png)


When we make 'GET' request again you will see the new record:
![GET](https://github.com/BackNot/SimpleWebApi/blob/master/PicturesOfProject/GETJSON3.png)



When you click the "Teachers" tab you are asked to authenticate youtself. (I've impemented basic authentication).
After that,  you can do the same operations that you did , but this time for the teachers.
